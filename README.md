This repository contains my projects on Power BI

I have experienced on using Power BI. I have even completed one order on my freelancing career as a data scientist on Fiverr with the job of creating Power BI dashboards.

**First Project: adultreport**

In this project I created four visualizations and also two metrices or cards to collect insights from an american adult report dataset. We can click on the specific bar chunk or label above the chart to find a more specific information. When we do this, all other visualizations also slice their visualizations to show the specified information we want earlier. This is a really useful feature that allows us to filter the data based on specific features.

The first visualization is called "Total Adults by Age and Education". This is a stacked bar chart visualization. This visualization can show us the total adults based on age and education.

The second visualization is called "Total Adults by occupation and relationship". This stacked bar chart shows us the total adults by the occupation including prof-specialty, sales, etc. and the relationship including husband, not-in-family, etc.

The third visualization is the pie chart one. It shows the total adults by race like white, black, and asian-pacific-islander.

The final visualization is a square chart which shows the total adults by their native country. The size of each square shows us the total adults in the specified native country.

I also made two metrices that show the total adults and the average of age. These two metrices will be changed as we do a specification on another chart. So for example, if we select only the united states part on the square chart, these two metrices will change into the correct total adults and average of age of all americans with United States as their native country.

**Second Project: Finance Report**

This dashboard is aimed to understand the financial condition of a company.

I created a filter checkboxes which we can use to check any of the boxes so the visualizations will adjust themselves to only show the content based on the checked boxes.

The first visualization is the stacked bar chart one. It shows the sum of gross sales, sales, and profit by the unique product.

The second visualization is the line chart one. It shows the same things like the visualization before but by the year and month.

The third visualization is the donut chart one. We can see the proportion of sales by the unique product the company sells.

I also created a world map visualization where we can check the sum of profit by the country where the product is sold.
